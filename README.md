# realsense-gstreamer

GStreamer source plugin for the Intel RealSense line of cameras. 

The plugin is actually two elements, a pure source and a demuxer. The source is set up as a GstPushSrc, based on [gst-vision-plugins](https://github.com/joshdoe/gst-plugins-vision) and GstVideoTestSrc. The demuxer is based on GstDVDemux from the gst-plugins-good package. 

The source element combines color and depth channels  and IMU into a single buffer passed to its source pad. The demuxer receives that buffer on its sink pad and splits it into color, depth and IMU buffers and and passes the buffers into the respective source pads. The IMU pad is configured as an audio pad with 6 channels of 32-bit floating point data.

The primary reason for this configuration is that GstBaseSrc, which GstPushSrc inherits, allows for only a single source pad. The use of the demuxer is not required. A downstream element may demux the itself buffer. This may be useful for processing that requires synchronized color and depth information.

## Supported Models
D435i has been tested.


## Building
As with GStreamer itself, the RealSense plugin uses the [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) build system. We have found this more user friendly than CMake. 

The plugin has been developed and tested on Ubuntu 18.04.

### Dependencies
- A compiler which supports C++17 
- GStreamer 1.0 or higher
    - Follow the [instructions](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/installing/index.html?gi-language=c) for your operating system.
- [Intel RealSense SDK](https://dev.intelrealsense.com/docs/installation)

### Build steps

1. Clone the repo and cd into repo directory.
```
git clone https://github.com/WKDSMRT/realsense-gstreamer.git
cd realsense-gstreamer
```
2. Setup up build directory, build and install
```
meson . build
sudo ninja -C build install
```
3. Inspect the resulting plugin.
```
gst-inspect-1.0 build/src/libgstrealsensesrc.so
```

### Tests
- The source may be run using gst-launch.
```
gst-launch-1.0 -v -m realsensesrc ! videoconvert ! autovideosink
```

### Properties
Several properties are implemented to control the function of the source plugin.


#### cam-serial-number
Specifies serial number of the camera to open. If no serial number is specified the plugin will open the first found RealSense device. To discover serial numbers rs-enumerate-devices can be utilized (for details see https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/blob/master/tools/enumerate-devices/readme.md)

#### align 
Controls the alignement between the color and depth frames.
| Value | Effect|
|--- | --- |
| 0 (Default) | No alignment |
| 1 | Align to color frame |
| 2 | Align to depth frame |

#### imu_on
Turns IMU streaming on/off.
| Value | Effect|
|--- | --- |
| True | IMU streaming |
| False | IMU not streaming |

#### stream-type
The stream-type property can control which video feed is created by the source: color, depth or multiplexed.
| Value | Effect|
|--- | --- |
| 0 | Color frames only |
| 1 (Default) | Depth frames only |
| 2 | Multiplxed Color and depth frames |

#### Example
The following gst-launch command exercises all the configurable properties of the source element.
```
gst-launch-1.0 realsensesrc cam-serial-number=918512070217 stream-type=2 align=0 imu_on=True ! videoconvert ! autovideosink 
```

### Metadata
The following information is added to buffer metadata as a GstMeta struct.

- Camera model
- Camera serial number
- Exposure 

The Realsense library exposes many other metadata values. The GstMeta struct can be added to if other Realsense metadata is needed by downstream elements.

## To Do

### Source
- Create bin element
- Investigate buffer optimizations in rsmux.hpp
    - use allocator or use from pool if that's more efficient or safer
    - use orc_memcpy
- src/rsmux.hpp:82:        // TODO refactor this section into cleaner code
- src/gstrealsensedemux.cpp:205:  // TODO Handle any necessary src queries
- src/gstrealsensedemux.cpp:221:  // TODO Handle any sink queries
- src/gstrealsensedemux.cpp:317:    // TODO handle src pad events here
- src/gstrealsensedemux.cpp:454:  // TODO What do we need to do in _flush?
- src/gstrealsenseplugin.cpp:334:          // FIXME Not exact format match
- Maybe add capability to generate synthetic data if no camera is connected.
    - Should be developer mode only

## Known Issues
- You must manually specify the plugin location. For example:
```
GST_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0/
export GST_PLUGIN_PATH
```

- When aligning to the depth frame, some areas of the rgb frame are blacked out. It's not clear if this is a RealSense bug or problem with the plugins.
